## Description



## Usage

The specification is stored as [JSON](http://json.org/), a lightweight data-interchange format. Many languages provide JSON support: [JavaScript](http://www.json.org/js.html), [Python](https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html), [Go](http://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/), [PHP](http://php.net/manual/en/book.json.php), [Java](http://json.org/java/), [Haskell](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/json), and [others](http://json.org/).

You are free to use the JSON specification, as is. Simply copy the file and use accordingly.

For those using package managers to manage dependencies, we provide package manager support, as outlined below.


### Bower

The specification is registered as a [Bower](http://bower.io) package. Bower provides a straightforward means for managing dependencies.

In order to use Bower, you must first install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). Once the prerequisites are installed,

``` bash
$ npm install -g bower
```

To [install](http://bower.io/docs/api/#install) the latest specification,

``` bash
$ bower install doc-metrix-cpu
```

Bower will place the specification in a `bower_components/` directory within the current working directory.

To [update](http://bower.io/docs/api/#update) to the latest specification,

``` bash
$ bower update doc-metrix-cpu
```
