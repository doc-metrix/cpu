Any updates to the specification should be tagged.\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\n$ git tag -a <major.minor.patch> -m \"[UPDATE] version.\"\r\n$ git push origin <major.minor.patch>\r\n```\r\n\r\nUse [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) (semvar) for communicating versions.\r\n\r\n*\tAny new metrics should be communicated as `minor` updates.\r\n*\tAny corrections/value modifications should be `patches`.\r\n* \tAny specification restructuring (changing field names, removing fields, etc) should be communicated as a `major` update.\r\n\r\n===\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nThe specification is stored as [JSON](http://json.org/), a lightweight data-interchange format. Many languages provide JSON support: [JavaScript](http://www.json.org/js.html), [Python](https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html), [Go](http://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/), [PHP](http://php.net/manual/en/book.json.php), [Java](http://json.org/java/), [Haskell](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/json), and [others](http://json.org/).\r\n\r\nYou are free to use the JSON specification, as is. Simply copy the file and use accordingly.\r\n\r\nFor those using package managers to manage dependencies, we provide package manager support, as outlined below.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Bower\r\n\r\nThe specification is registered as a [Bower](http://bower.io) package. Bower provides a straightforward means for managing dependencies.\r\n\r\nIn order to use Bower, you must first install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). Once the prerequisites are installed,\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\n$ npm install -g bower\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo [install](http://bower.io/docs/api/#install) the latest specification,\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\n$ bower install doc-metrix-cpu\r\n```\r\n\r\nBower will place the specification in a `bower_components/` directory within the current working directory.\r\n\r\nTo [update](http://bower.io/docs/api/#update) to the latest specification,\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\n$ bower update doc-metrix-cpu\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Utilities\r\n\r\nList of utilities using this specification:\r\n\r\n*\t[Node.js Module](https://github.com/doc-metrix/cpu-node)\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n## License\r\n\r\n[MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). \r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Copyright\r\n\r\nCopyright &copy; 2014.
